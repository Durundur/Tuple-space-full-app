# Tuple Space Project

Project concept is to develop a tuple space middleware for distributed computing. This middleware is designed to facilitate communication and coordination among processes in distributed systems by utilizing the concept of tuple spaces. The tuple space is treated as an associative memory where tuples are stored and processes communicate by adding and retrieving tuples from this space. An important feature of this approach is the lack of direct message exchange between processes - instead, processes place data in the tuple space or retrieve it from there.

The main components of the tuple space project include the server, applications, and the communication protocol.

- Server:
The server serves as the central point managing the tuple space. It is responsible for storing tuples, handling requests for adding and retrieving tuples, and ensuring the integrity and reliability of tuple space operations. The server plays a crucial role in ensuring consistency and synchronization of access to the tuple space in a distributed environment.

- Applications:
Within the tuple space project, simple applications are created to serve as examples of using the developed middleware. These applications aim to demonstrate how the middleware facilitates the development of various applications. Additionally, these applications can be used to test the implementation of the middleware and showcase its functionality.

- Communication Protocol:
The tuple space project involves the use of its own communication protocol operating over UDP. This protocol facilitates communication between the client and the server maintaining the tuple space, aiming to ensure reliability and data integrity in communication between processes in distributed systems. The protocol features a binary message structure, contributing to efficient data transmission over the network while also optimizing network utilization.
